Thanks for taking the time to review this challenge.

My process went as follows:

1. Creating `IBusinessDayCounter` Interface: I began by defining the `IBusinessDayCounter` interface to provide a clear contract for the functionality required.
2. Reading the Challenge PDF: I thoroughly read and understood the challenge requirements outlined in the provided PDF document.
3. Step-by-Step Implementation: I followed the challenge instructions step-by-step, adding new methods to the `IBusinessDayCounter` interface as needed to meet the requirements.
4. Test-Driven Development (TDD): For each new method added to the interface, I implemented corresponding unit tests to ensure the correctness of my code. I followed the TDD approach, where tests were written before the actual code.
5. Logic Implementation: After writing the tests, I implemented the logic for each method in the concrete class that implements the IBusinessDayCounter interface.
6. Verification through Testing: I regularly ran the unit tests to verify my logic. If the tests failed, I would revisit and refactor the code until all tests passed successfully.
7. Refactoring: Once I had a working solution, I focused on refactoring the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
